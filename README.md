# Syzygy

## What is this?
Syzygy is a far future/space table top role playing game (TTRPG) to be played
with your friends. This simple web app provides the game rules and character
sheets.

## Notes:
This app uses modern JavaScript and is not bundled, minified, or transpiled so
if it doesn't work it's probably time to update your browser or try another one.
([Try Firefox, it's great.](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/))

This app is also not currently backed by any API or cloud storage, so data is
stored locally in your browser. This means:
* If you move to another browser or device you will not see your characters.
* If you clear your browser cache you will lose your characters.

This may all change in the future, but for now this is largely proof of concept.
